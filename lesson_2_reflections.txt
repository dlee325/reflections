[  CREATING AND MODIFYING A REPOSITORY]



[ INTRODUCTION]

Repositories store a bunch of metadata about the history of the repository since creation. There is a bunch of hidden directories and files (starts with a .) in the main directories of the repository.

[How to Create a Repository]
You can create repositories in an empty directory and create files later or create the repository in a directory that already contains the files.

ls -a   	# shows you a list of  directories and files in the directory.
git init   	# initializes or creates a new git repository.
git status  # shows you which files have changed since the last commit.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

the diagram the way we do?

*Reflection*
What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
